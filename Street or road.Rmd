Your turn: Read the following R statements. Next to each line, give a short explanation of what the line contributes to the task. For each of the regexes, explain in simple everyday language what pattern is being matched.
```{r}
pattern <- "(ST|RD|ROAD|CIRCLE)" # looking for a pattern street or road names
LeftOvers <- #saves everything in a leftOvers table
  Addresses %>% # pulls data from source
  filter( ! grepl(pattern, address),# filters out what we dont want to see
          ! grepl("\\sAPT|UNIT\\s[\\d]+$", address), # looking for anything with apartments 
          ! grepl(" BOX ", address)
          )


```

```{r}
